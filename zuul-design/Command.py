'''
This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application. 
"World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  

This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
A command currently consists of two strings: a command word and a second
word (for example, if the command was "take map", then the two strings
obviously are "take" and "map").

The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
known) then the command word is <null>.

If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
