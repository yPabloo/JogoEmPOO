'''
This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. 
"World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users 
can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended 
to make it more interesting!

To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
method.

This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
executes the commands that the parser returns.
