Class Room - a room in an adventure game.

This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application. 
"World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  

A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
connected to other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled north, 
east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference
to the neighboring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction.
