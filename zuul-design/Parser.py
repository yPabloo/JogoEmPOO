'''
This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application. 
"World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  

This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
tries to interpret the line as a two word command. It returns the command
as an object of class Command.

The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it
returns a command object that is marked as an unknown command.
